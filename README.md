BobEngine
=========

A 2D game engine for Android

This repository contains the library projects and example projects for BobEngine, a 2D game engine for Android. This engine is still in it's very early stages and there is still lots of work to do so stay tuned!

Examples and tutorials are coming soon, as my schedule permits. (University keeps me busy!)

Currently, BobEngine may be used to create commercial or non-commercial games. This is subject to change at any time.
