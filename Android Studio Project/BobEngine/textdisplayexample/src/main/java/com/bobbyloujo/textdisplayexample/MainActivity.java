				 * A QUICK NOTE ABOUT CHANGING THE FONT/TYPEFACE:
				 *
				 * You can create your own typeface to use with TextDisplay. The default typeface
				 * can be found in the bobEngine module drawable folder is named 'characters.png'.
				 *
				 * CHARACTER ARRANGEMENT:
				 *
				 * Note that the characters are arranged in columns (just like frames in any other GameObject).
				 * You can arrange them in any order you want AND use whatever characters you want (you are not
				 * restricted to the characters shown on the default typeface). You must call setOrder(String order)
				 * with a string that contains all the characters on your typeface graphic in the order that they
				 * are arranged in your graphic.
				 *
				 * ***Use the setGraphic(Graphic g, int columns, int rows) function to set your graphic!
				 *
				 * KERNING:
				 *
				 * Kerning is super tedious and annoying, unfortunately, but there is no simple way to fix this (except
				 * by using a fixed-width font, but that isn't really a fix). For proper kerning, place your characters
				 * against the left edge of their frame in your typeface graphic. Measure the width of each character
				 * in pixels and then divide that width by the width of a single whole frame on your graphic to get the
				 * kerning value for that character (a character that takes up the whole frame would have a kerning value
				 * of 1). Create an array of doubles with the kerning values of each character in the order that they
				 * appear on you graphic. Call setKerning(double kerning[]) to set the kerning for your typeface.
